# HexagonCodingExercise
The app has been developed as a console application. Running the app via visual studio will enable the user to enter commands for the robot on each line.  
You can alternatively read the commands from a file. This is controlled via an appsetting in the json configuration file


## Software Requirements
Visual Studio 2017 or above  
dotnet core 2.1  

## Reading instructions from a file  
You can toggle the setting named `readCommandsFromFile` in appsettings.json. This will toggle between whether the 
commands are read from command line input or a file from disk  

## Existing Test Data
In the solution there is a TestData folder containing a couple of test data files you can use to test the solution.
